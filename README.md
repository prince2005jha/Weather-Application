## Code Walkthrough

### HTML
- **Input Field**: Provides a text input for the user to specify the location.
  ```html
  <input type="text" id="location" placeholder="Enter Location">
  ```
- **Button**: Triggers the weather fetching process.
  ```html
  <button onclick="getWeather()">Get Weather</button>
  ```

### CSS
- **Styling**: Implements a responsive and visually appealing design with a gradient background and centered layout.
  ```css
  body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background: linear-gradient(to right, #6dd5fa, #2980b9);
      color: #fff;
  }
  ```

### JavaScript
- **Fetch Weather Data**: Sends a request to the WeatherAPI and processes the response to display the data.
  ```javascript
  async function getWeather() {
      const apiKey = 'your_api_key_here';
      const location = document.getElementById('location').value;
      const apiUrl = `http://api.weatherapi.com/v1/current.json?key=${apiKey}&q=${location}&aqi=yes`;
      const response = await fetch(apiUrl);
      const data = await response.json();
      document.getElementById('result').innerHTML = `Temperature: ${data.current.temp_c}Â°C`;
  }
  ```

## Future Enhancements

- Include additional data like wind speed, humidity, and air quality.
- Implement autocomplete suggestions for location input.
- Optimize for offline use by caching recent weather data.
